# Spotify_Database_SQL_Query

This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced). The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

1. Data Exploration

Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:

  Artist: The performer of the track.
  Track: The name of the song.
  Album: The album to which the track belongs.
  Album_type: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
  Various metrics such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.

2. Querying the Data

After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into easy, medium, and advanced levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

  Easy Queries
  Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.

  Medium Queries
  More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.

  Advanced Queries
  Nested subqueries, window functions,
